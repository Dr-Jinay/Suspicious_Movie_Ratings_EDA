# Suspicious_Movie_Ratings_EDA
This repository contains Exploratory Data Analysis for a movie ratings dataset of few well-known websites such as RottenTomatoes, Metacritic, IMDB and Fandango. 

### Overview:
If you are planning on going out to see a movie, how well can you trust online reviews and ratings? *Especially* if the same company showing the rating *also* makes money by selling movie tickets. Do they have a bias towards rating movies higher than they should be rated?

### Goal:

**The goal is to complete the tasks below based off the 538 article and see if you reach a similar conclusion. You will need to use your pandas and visualization skills to determine if Fandango's ratings in 2015 had a bias towards rating movies better to sell more tickets.**

### The Data:

This is the data behind the story [Be Suspicious Of Online Movie Ratings, Especially Fandangoâ€™s](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/) openly available on 538's github: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data. There are two csv files, one with Fandango Stars and Displayed Ratings, and the other with aggregate data for movie ratings from other sites, like Metacritic,IMDB, and Rotten Tomatoes.
